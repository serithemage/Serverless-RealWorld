# Task ID: 11
# Title: Article Service Lambda Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement Lambda functions for article management
# Details:
1. Create Lambda functions for article operations:
   - Create article
   - Get article
   - Update article
   - Delete article
   - List articles
   - Favorite article
   - Unfavorite article
   - Add comment
   - Get comments
   - Delete comment
2. Implement business logic for each operation
3. Integrate with DynamoDB repositories
4. Add authentication and authorization checks
5. Implement event publishing to SQS FIFO queue for article changes
   - Utilize FIFO queue characteristics (order guarantee, exactly-once processing)
   - Ensure data consistency for articles and comments
   - Apply SOLID principles and Clean Architecture for event publishing logic
   - Implement proper message group IDs to maintain ordering where needed
6. Add logging and error handling
7. Implement pagination and filtering for list operations
8. Optimize Lambda performance (memory, timeout)

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit test each Lambda function
2. Integration test with DynamoDB and SQS FIFO queue
3. Test authentication and authorization
4. Validate event publishing to SQS FIFO queue
   - Verify message ordering is maintained
   - Test deduplication functionality
   - Ensure consistency guarantees are met
5. Test pagination and filtering
6. Performance test article operations
7. Test error handling and recovery scenarios with SQS FIFO
