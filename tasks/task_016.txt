# Task ID: 16
# Title: Performance Testing and Optimization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
# Priority: low
# Description: Conduct performance testing and optimize serverless components
# Details:
1. Set up performance testing framework (Artillery, Locust, etc.)
2. Define performance test scenarios
3. Implement load tests for critical paths
4. Analyze Lambda cold start times
5. Optimize Lambda memory allocation
6. Configure provisioned concurrency for critical functions
7. Implement caching strategies
8. Optimize DynamoDB read/write capacity
9. Analyze and optimize API Gateway performance
10. Document performance benchmarks

# Test Strategy:
1. Run baseline performance tests
2. Compare performance before and after optimizations
3. Test cold start scenarios
4. Validate provisioned concurrency
5. Test under various load conditions
6. Verify performance meets requirements
