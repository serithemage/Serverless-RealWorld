# Task ID: 13
# Title: Event Handlers Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9, 10, 11, 12
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement Lambda functions for processing events from SQS FIFO queues
# Details:
1. Create Lambda functions for event processing:
   - User event handler
   - Article event handler
   - Comment event handler
2. Configure SQS FIFO triggers for Lambda functions
3. Implement simplified event processing logic utilizing FIFO queue characteristics
4. Leverage FIFO queue's guaranteed ordering and exactly-once processing
5. Add error handling and dead-letter queue processing
6. Implement idempotent event processing as a fallback mechanism
7. Add logging and monitoring
8. Optimize batch size and concurrency while maintaining FIFO guarantees

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit test event handler functions
2. Integration test with SQS FIFO queues
3. Test message ordering guarantees
4. Verify exactly-once processing functionality
5. Test error handling and retries
6. Validate idempotent processing as fallback
7. Performance test event processing with FIFO constraints
