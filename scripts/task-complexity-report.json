      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the AWS CDK project setup into subtasks such as installing prerequisites, initializing the project, organizing the folder structure, configuring environments, and creating the base stack.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves several foundational steps but each is well-documented and follows standard AWS CDK patterns. Complexity is moderate due to environment configuration and project structuring, but not high since it doesn't require advanced AWS knowledge."
